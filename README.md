# Introduction to cyber security A
## Encryption-Decryption demo.
assignment 3 of course.

1. Read first row of each file.
2. Taken the first letter of the original file and replaced it with it's numeric value.
3. Encryption function receives two `int` variables.
4. Loops throughout the entire key range, so that each time the letter is sent to the encryption function and there is a match testing to the files. the moment which all the keys are found, the counter, which represents the amount of files in the folder, ends the loop.
5. at the moment a key is found, a listing is added to the `answers.txt` file.

a crude example, which can be greatly improved by just adding a correct use of `hash tables`, and division of labour between multiple machines.
